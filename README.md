A responsive clone of YouTube's homepage UI layout created using semantic HTML and pure CSS. This project was built to replicate a real-world platform interface and practice multi-section structuring, responsiveness, and visual hierarchy.

---

## Overview

This project is a static clone of YouTube’s homepage interface, built entirely with semantic HTML and custom CSS. The layout includes a sticky header, sidebar navigation, responsive video grid, and tooltips which are all crafted without using JavaScript.

The goal of this build was to practice real-world UI replication while applying responsive design techniques, Flexbox, and CSS Grid. It also reinforced clean class structuring, hover interactions, and layout adaptability for multiple screen sizes.
